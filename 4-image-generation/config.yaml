# ## Enabling Caching
#
# SDXL is a very large model, and downloading it could take up to 10 minutes. This means
# that the cold start time for this model is long. We can solve that by using our build
# caching feature. This moves the model download to the build stage of your model--
# caching the model will take about 10 minutes initially but you will get ~9s cold starts
# subsequently.
# 
# To enable caching, add the following to the config:
# ```yaml
# hf_cache:
#   - repo_id: madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix
#     allow_patterns:
#       - config.json
#       - diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
#   - repo_id: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
#     allow_patterns:
#       - "*.json"
#       - "*.fp16.safetensors"
#       - sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors
#   - repo_id: stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0
#     allow_patterns:
#       - "*.json"
#       - "*.fp16.safetensors"
#       - sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors
# ```
# # Deploy the model
# 
# Deploy the model like you would other Trusses, with:
# ```bash
# $ truss push
# ```
# You can then invoke the model with:
# ```bash
# $ truss predict -d '{"prompt": "A tree in a field under the night sky", "use_refiner": true}'
# ```
