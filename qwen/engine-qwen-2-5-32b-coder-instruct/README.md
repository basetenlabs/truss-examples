# Qwen Coder 2.5 32B Instruct Engine

This example uses the [TensorRT-LLM Engine Builder for Qwen](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/examples/qwen-trt) to build and deploy an optimized inference engine for Qwen Coder 2.5 32B Instruct.

For advanced control over the engine building process, see [engine control in Python](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/engine-builder-customization) and [engine builder configuration](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/engine-builder-config) docs.
