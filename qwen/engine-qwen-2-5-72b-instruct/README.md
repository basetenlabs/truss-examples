# Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct Engine

This example uses the [TensorRT-LLM Engine Builder for Qwen](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/examples/qwen-trt) to build and deploy an optimized inference engine for Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct.

Note that while other sizes of Qwen 2.5 are licensed as Apache 2.0, 72B sizes use the [qwen license](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct/blob/main/LICENSE).

For advanced control over the engine building process, see [engine control in Python](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/engine-builder-customization) and [engine builder configuration](https://docs.baseten.co/performance/engine-builder-config) docs.
