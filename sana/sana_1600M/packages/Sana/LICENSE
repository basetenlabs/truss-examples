1. Definitions

“Licensor” means any person or entity that distributes its Work.

“Work” means (a) the original work of authorship made available under
this license, which may include software, documentation, or other
files, and (b) any additions to or derivative works  thereof
that are made available under this license.

“NVIDIA Processors” means any central processing unit (CPU),
graphics processing unit (GPU), field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or any combination
thereof designed, made, sold, or provided by NVIDIA or its affiliates.

The terms “reproduce,” “reproduction,” “derivative works,” and
“distribution” have the meaning as provided under U.S. copyright law;
provided, however, that for the purposes of this license, derivative
works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work.

Works are “made available” under this license by including in or with
the Work either (a) a copyright notice referencing the applicability
of this license to the Work, or (b) a copy of this license.

"Safe Model" means ShieldGemma-2B, which is a series of safety
content moderation models designed to moderate four categories of
harmful content: sexually explicit material, dangerous content,
hate speech, and harassment, and which you separately obtain
from Google at https://huggingface.co/google/shieldgemma-2b.

3.2 Derivative Works. You may specify that additional or different

3.4  You shall filter your input content to the Work and any derivative
works thereof through the Safe Model to ensure that no content described
as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) is processed or generated. You shall not use
the Work to process or generate NSFW content. You are solely responsible
for any damages and liabilities arising from your failure to adequately
filter content in accordance with this section.  As used herein,
“Not Safe For Work” or “NSFW” means content, videos or website pages
that contain potentially disturbing subject matter, including but not
limited to content that is sexually explicit, dangerous, hate,
or harassment.

3.5 Patent Claims. If you bring or threaten to bring a patent claim

any Work, then your rights under this license from such Licensor
(including the grant in Section 2.1) will terminate immediately.

3.6 Trademarks. This license does not grant any rights to use any

rights under this license (including the grant in Section 2.1) will
terminate immediately.

UNDER THIS LICENSE.

5. Limitation of Liability.

EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL
THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE
SHALL ANY LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT,
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WORK

LOST PROFITS OR DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER
DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
