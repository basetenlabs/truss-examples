# Textual Inversion with Stable Diffusion

The following example demonstrates how to use Stable Diffusion with
textual inversion embeddings.

This truss combines concepts from:
1. [This colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_conceptualizer_inference.ipynb#scrollTo=JkIeuLEfqi-g) which demonstrates how to load textual inversion embeddings from hugginface repos
2. [This diffusers issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/3097#issuecomment-1516138396) which demonstrates how to load an embedding directly.
