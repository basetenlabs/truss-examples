On 25 Dec 2024, Kokoro v0.19 weights were permissively released in full fp32 precision under an Apache 2.0 license. As of 2 Jan 2025, 10 unique Voicepacks have been released, and a .onnx version of v0.19 is available.In the weeks leading up to its release, Kokoro v0.19 was the #1ðŸ¥‡ ranked model in TTS Spaces Arena. Kokoro had achieved higher Elo in this single-voice Arena setting over other models, using fewer parameters and less data. Kokoro's ability to top this Elo ladder suggests that the scaling law (Elo vs compute/data/params) for traditional TTS models might have a steeper slope than previously expected.", "voice": "af", "speed": 1.0}
