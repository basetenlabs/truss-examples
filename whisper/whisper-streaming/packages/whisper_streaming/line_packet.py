"""Functions for sending and receiving individual lines of text over a socket.

Used by marian-server-server.py to communicate with the Marian worker.

A line is transmitted using one or more fixed-size packets of UTF-8 bytes
containing:

  - Zero or more bytes of UTF-8, excluding \n and \0, followed by

  - Zero or more \0 bytes as required to pad the packet to PACKET_SIZE
