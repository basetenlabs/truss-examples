# # Deploying the model
#
# An important note for deploying models with secrets is that
# you must use the `--trusted` flag to give the model access to
# secrets stored on the remote secrets manager.
#
# ```bash
# $ truss push --trusted
# ```
#
# After the model finishes deploying, you can invoke it with:
# ```bash
# $ truss predict -d '"It is a [MASK] world"'
# ```
