# Baseten-Embeddings-Inference with baseten/example-Meta-Llama-3-70B-InstructForSequenceClassification

This is a Deployment for BEI (Baseten-Embeddings-Inference) with baseten/example-Meta-Llama-3-70B-InstructForSequenceClassification. BEI is Baseten's solution for production-grade deployments via TensorRT-LLM.

With BEI you get the following benefits:
- *Lowest-latency inference* across any embedding solution (vLLM, SGlang, Infinity, TEI, Ollama)<sup>1</sup>
- *Highest-throughput inference* across any embedding solution (vLLM, SGlang, Infinity, TEI, Ollama) - thanks to XQA kernels, FP8 and dynamic batching.<sup>2</sup>
- High parallelism: up to 1400 client embeddings per second
- Cached model weights for fast vertical scaling and high availability - no Hugging Face hub dependency at runtime

# Examples:
This deployment is specifically designed for the Hugging Face model [baseten/example-Meta-Llama-3-70B-InstructForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/baseten/example-Meta-Llama-3-70B-InstructForSequenceClassification).
It will also work for fine-tuned models that have the architecture of LlamaForSequenceClassification specified in their Hugging Face transformers config.
Suitable models can be identified by the `ForSequenceClassification` suffix in the model name. Prediction models may have one or more labels, which are returned with the prediction.

baseten/example-Meta-Llama-3-70B-InstructForSequenceClassification  is a text-classification model, used to classify a text into a category. \nIt is frequently used in sentiment analysis, spam detection, and more. It's also used for deployment of chat rating models, e.g. RLHF reward models or toxicity detection models.

This model is quantized to FP8 for deployment, which is supported by Nvidia's newest GPUs e.g. H100, H100_40GB or L4. Quantization is optional, but leads to higher efficiency.

## Deployment with Truss

Before deployment:

1. Make sure you have a [Baseten account](https://app.baseten.co/signup) and [API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys).
2. Install the latest version of Truss: `pip install --upgrade truss`


First, clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/basetenlabs/truss-examples.git
cd 11-embeddings-reranker-classification-tensorrt/BEI-baseten-example-meta-llama-3-70b-instructforsequenceclassification
```

With `11-embeddings-reranker-classification-tensorrt/BEI-baseten-example-meta-llama-3-70b-instructforsequenceclassification` as your working directory, you can deploy the model with the following command. Paste your Baseten API key if prompted.

```sh
truss push --publish
# prints:
# âœ¨ Model BEI-baseten-example-meta-llama-3-70b-instructforsequenceclassification-truss-example was successfully pushed âœ¨
# ðŸªµ  View logs for your deployment at https://app.baseten.co/models/yyyyyy/logs/xxxxxx
```

## Call your model

### API-Schema:
POST-Route: `https://model-xxxxxx.api.baseten.co/environments/production/sync/predict`
```json
{
  "inputs": "Baseten is a fast inference provider",
  "raw_scores": false,
  "truncate": false,
  "truncation_direction": "right"
}
```

Returns:
```json
[
  {
    "label": "excitement",
    "score": 0.99
  }
]
```
Important, this is different from the `predict` route: https://model-xxxxxx.api.baseten.co/environments/production/predict
The OpenAPI.json is available under https://model-xxxxxx.api.baseten.co/environments/production/sync/openapi.json for more details.

#### Advanced:
You may also use Baseten's async jobs API, which returns a request_id, which you can use to query the status of the job and get the results.

POST-Route: `https://model-xxxxxx.api.baseten.co/environments/production/async/predict`
Read more about [Baseten's Async API here](https://docs.baseten.co/invoke/async)

### OpenAI compatible client library
OpenAI does not have a classification endpoint, therefore no client library is available.


## Config.yaml
By default, the following configuration is used for this deployment. If you want to remove the quantization, remove the `quantization_type` field or set it to `no_quant` for float16.

```yaml
build_commands: []
environment_variables: {}
external_package_dirs: []
model_metadata:
  example_model_input:
    input: This redirects to the embedding endpoint. Use the /sync API to reach /sync/predict
      endpoint.
