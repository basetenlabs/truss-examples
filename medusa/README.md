# Medusa

This is a [Truss](https://truss.baseten.co/) for Medusa. Truss is an open-source model serving framework developed by Baseten. Medusa is a high-performance inference-time optimization for large language models. By training linear dense layers on top of the final latent representation from a large language model, Medusa `heads` can predict multiple tokens in a single forward pass, which can significantly reduce the time required to generate text.
